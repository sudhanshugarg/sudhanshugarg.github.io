## Statistics Glossary
 - Statistics has a lot of terms that are possibly unfamiliar to us at times, and its good to maintain a glossary of the same.
 - I plan to keep updating this as I come across new terms, and the some useful links that explain them well.

Term | Layman Meaning | Reference
-- | -- | --
Random Variable | A variable that can take on different values instead of a single value | [Video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library/random-variables-discrete/v/random-variables)
Expected Value (of a random variable) | mean (weighted by probability per value) | [Video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/random-variables-ap/discrete-random-variables/v/expected-value-of-a-discrete-random-variable)
Standard Deviation | math formula | 
Variance | std^2 | 
Normal Distribution | math formula | 
Probability Distribution Function (PDF) | Histogram displaying relative frequencies of each possible value of the random variable | [Video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library/random-variables-continuous/v/probability-density-functions)
Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) | Graph (formed from the PDF), showing the probability that the random variable will take a value <= some value. | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ6Q9W3Y1ZE)
Z-score / Z-statistic | given the value of a random variable, how many standard deviations away is it from the mean of that random variable | 
Sampling Distribution | given a sample of the population, and drawing multiple samples of the same size, what is the distribution of any sample. | [Videos](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/sampling-distributions-library)
Central Limit Theorem | the sampling distribution of the mean of ANY distribution is a normal distribution | [Video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/sampling-distribution-ap/sampling-distribution-mean/v/central-limit-theorem)
Hypothesis Testing |  |
